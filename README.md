# E-tourguide

E-tourguide is a tour planner application written in React Native - Expo CLI (frontend) and Strapi CMS (backend) with SQLite database. 
The main purpose of the application is to plan a tour route for the client with various attractions. Every attraction is provided with interesting informations both in audio and text format. With the Google Directions and Distance Matrix APIs the application provides precise turn by turn directions and navigations based on the client's current location. 

The client is able to choose a city where he wants to tour. At the moment there is only one city available, but my goal is to expand the application worldwide. Every city has various tour categories, like example nature, buildings...

I won't share the code for this project, because I am still working on it to deploy it to the App/Play store, but images of the app can be found in the images folder.
